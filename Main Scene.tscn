The game will calculate a score based on its state (cards in the Game Area). The goal is to guess how the score is computed. You have as many guesses as necessary. You enter a guess in the textbox to the left of the Deck.

The dark box is the Game Board. 
You may add cards to the Game Area by dragging and dropping them from the orange square (the deck).

Cards are drawn at random. However, it is also possible to \"Cheat\" in order to control the top card of the deck. To activate cheat mode, press the cheat button.
